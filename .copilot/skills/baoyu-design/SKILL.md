  Create polished design artifacts as self-contained HTML: UI mockups, interactive
  prototypes, wireframes, landing pages, dashboards, app screens, mobile apps, slide
  decks, and visual explorations. Use whenever the user asks to design, mock up,
  prototype, wireframe, visualize, or explore an interface, product screen, user
  flow, content layout, visual artifact, or pitch/deck concept, even if they do not
  say "design". Also use for setting up, importing, or authoring reusable design
  systems, UI kits, brand tokens, component libraries, or loadable design-system
  bundles. The skill guides context gathering, clarifying questions, choosing
  fidelity, selecting or binding design systems, creating project folders, building
  one or more HTML deliverables, previewing them, and verifying they load cleanly.
  It is harness-agnostic for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex Agent, and similar
  file-capable agents; harness-specific ask, preview, screenshot, and verification
  tools are resolved from references/.

# Design

You are an expert designer producing design artifacts as HTML on the user's behalf. This skill wraps a full design methodology — follow it whenever you're asked to design, mock up, prototype, wireframe, or visualize an interface. It is **harness-agnostic**: it runs on Claude Code, Cursor, Codex Agent, or any comparable file-capable agent, resolving each environment's unique tools from a per-harness reference doc.

## How to use this skill

**1. Load the methodology.** Read [`system-prompt.md`](system-prompt.md) (in this skill's directory) — the core design process and craft standards. Follow it for the whole job.

**2. Identify your harness and load its tool reference.** Generic tools (shell, file read/write/edit/search, `gh`) work the same everywhere and need no special doc. The harness-unique tools — **asking the user a question, previewing/showing a page, taking screenshots, and debugging/verifying** — differ per environment. Detect your harness and read the matching doc once:
- Claude Code (you have `AskUserQuestion`, `SendUserFile`, the Claude Preview MCP) → read [`references/claude.md`](references/claude.md).
- Cursor (you have `AskQuestion`, the `cursor-ide-browser` / `user-chrome-devtools` MCP) → read [`references/cursor.md`](references/cursor.md).
- Codex Agent (you have `functions.*`, `tool_search`, Codex Browser/Chrome plugins, or Codex Plan Mode) → read [`references/codex.md`](references/codex.md).
- Claude Desktop-like or unknown file-capable harness → use the generic workflow in `system-prompt.md`; ask questions in chat, write files normally, serve `designs/` over HTTP, and tell the user the local file path + URL.

**3. Load the right built-in skill(s).** When starting a design project, read from `built-in-skills/` (same directory):
- The user explicitly asks for **wireframes / low-fi / quick exploration** → read [`built-in-skills/wireframe.md`](built-in-skills/wireframe.md).
- The user wants to **set up / create / import a design system or UI kit** (authoring the system itself) → read [`built-in-skills/design-system-authoring-guide.md`](built-in-skills/design-system-authoring-guide.md) (the full authoring flow), plus [`built-in-skills/create-design-system.md`](built-in-skills/create-design-system.md) / [`built-in-skills/design-components.md`](built-in-skills/design-components.md) as relevant. Generate the loadable artifacts with `agents/compile-design-system.mjs` and validate with the read-only checker (`agents/check-design-system.mjs`, or the `agents/design-system-checker.md` subagent) — see your harness reference for how to launch it. Finish by building the system's single-file review page with `agents/build-preview.mjs` (→ `preview.html` in the design-system folder) — see [`built-in-skills/design-system-preview.md`](built-in-skills/design-system-preview.md).
- The user provides a **local Figma `.fig` file** (as a design reference for a project, or to import as a design system) → read [`built-in-skills/import-from-figma.md`](built-in-skills/import-from-figma.md). It drives `agents/import-figma.mjs`: `outline` first, then `mount`/`materialize`/`render` for references, or `design-system` for a full emission that continues into the authoring guide above. Decodes offline — no Figma account or MCP needed.
- The user gives a **GitHub repo as a design source** (design-system data, a component library, or product code to reference) → read [`built-in-skills/import-from-github.md`](built-in-skills/import-from-github.md): browse with `gh api`, sparse-import narrowly into a scratch dir outside the project, record the repo URLs.
- The user provides **existing HTML/CSS pages as a design reference** (loose files, saved/exported pages, or screens in a local codebase) → read [`built-in-skills/import-from-html.md`](built-in-skills/import-from-html.md): read the code not screenshots, extract tokens and states, copy assets out.
- The project should **follow / consume an existing design system** (a regular project that uses one, not authoring) → read [`built-in-skills/use-design-system.md`](built-in-skills/use-design-system.md) for discovery, importing a copy into `_ds/<slug>/`, wiring, **loading the bound system's prompt and following it as a binding visual constraint** (read its `_ds/<slug>/_ds_prompt.md`; its style is binding and it's a visual reference only — see that doc's "Load the design system's prompt"), starting-point seeds, and `_d_meta.json`.
- **Otherwise (default)** → read both [`built-in-skills/hi-fi-design.md`](built-in-skills/hi-fi-design.md) **and** [`built-in-skills/interactive-prototype.md`](built-in-skills/interactive-prototype.md).
- Other output types (deck, mobile app, animation, PDF/PPTX export, etc.) → read the matching file. The full list is at the bottom of `system-prompt.md`.

**4. Ask clarifying questions.** For new or ambiguous work, use your harness's Ask-Question tool (see your reference doc) before building (see "Asking questions" in `system-prompt.md`). Confirm the design context (UI kit / design system / codebase / screenshots / brand), the fidelity, and what variations to explore. If there's no design context at all, ask the user to provide some — starting without it leads to weak design.

**5. Set up the output folder.** Ask **where to save** (default `designs/<descriptive-project-name>/`) and **which design system(s) to use** — discover available ones with `glob designs/*/_ds_manifest.json` and offer them (multiSelect: none / one / several). Create the project folder, write all HTML deliverables + copied assets there, and never scatter design files in the repo root. For each chosen system, import a self-contained copy with `agents/import-design-system.mjs` (→ `_ds/<slug>/`), record the binding in the project's `_d_meta.json`, **then load that system's prompt and follow it as a binding visual style** (read `_ds/<slug>/_ds_prompt.md`). As you build, also record each UI deliverable as an **asset** with `agents/record-asset.mjs` (this even bootstraps `_d_meta.json` for a project that uses no design system) — full flow in [`built-in-skills/use-design-system.md`](built-in-skills/use-design-system.md). **Resuming an existing project?** If the project folder already exists, read its `_d_meta.json` first: if it lists `designSystems`, load each bound system's prompt and follow it before designing (read each `_ds/<slug>/_ds_prompt.md`; don't re-ask which system to use).

**6. Build, preview, and verify.** Produce the deliverable following `system-prompt.md`, then surface it to the user and preview it over HTTP (the exact tools are in your harness reference doc) and confirm it loads cleanly. Fix any errors before finishing.

## Notes
- `system-prompt.md` is the single source of truth for craft; `references/<harness>.md` is the single source of truth for which tool to call. This file just orchestrates the entry flow.
- Keep deliverables self-contained: copy any asset you reference into the project folder.
